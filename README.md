## Key Considerations

- **Sharpe Ratio**  
  Calculated assuming a zero risk-free rate and annualized by a factor of $\sqrt{365}$.

- **Model Version**  
  Version 2 of the strategy was deployed on **May 15, 2025 00:00:00 UTC**, superseding the original implementation.

- **Net Performance**  
  All metrics reflect returns net of transaction costs and slippage.

- **Leverage & Scaling**  
  While the strategy may employ dynamic leverage and capital adjustments, all return series are reported on a zero-leverage basis for comparability.
