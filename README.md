# Quant Strategy Live Performance Tracking

This repository showcases a quantitative trading strategy I have been running in the crypto market since January 31 2025.
It generates daily performance metrics and plots that reflect **realized** (live) results.

## Overview

- **Daily Metrics:**  
  The `evaluation_summary.csv` file highlights key performance and risk statisticsâ€”such as Sharpe ratio, drawdowns, volatility, and other metrics.
- **Plots:**  
  The `results/plots/` directory contains visualizations (e.g., cumulative returns).
