# Quant Strategy Live Performance Tracking

This repository showcases a quantitative trading strategy I have been running in the crypto market since January 31 2025. It generates daily performance metrics and plots that reflect **realized** results.

**Daily Metrics:**  
  The `evaluation_summary.csv` file contains key performance and risk statistics, such as Sharpe ratio, MDD and volatility.
  
**Plots:**  
  The `cumulative_return_unlevered.png` file shows the cumulative return of the strategy.
