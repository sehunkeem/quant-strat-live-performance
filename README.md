# Quant Strategy - Live Performance Tracking

This repository demonstrates a quantitative trading strategy I have been running in the crypto market since January 31, 2025. It automatically generates daily performance metrics and plots to reflect the strategy’s realized results.

**Daily Metrics:**  
  The `evaluation_summary.csv` file contains key performance and risk statistics, such as the Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and volatility.
  
**Plots:**  
  The `cumulative_return_unlevered.png` file shows the cumulative return of the strategy over time.
